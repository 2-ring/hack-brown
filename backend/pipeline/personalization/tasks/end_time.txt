<task name="end_time">
The event has a start time but NO end time. Infer a reasonable end time.

Use:
- Event context. e.g. how long is a standard dentist checkup?
- The duration data from the user's own history of similar events. Consider if something about it suggests it might be shorter or longer than typical.
- Any nearby events listed. e.g. "Bus to Class" should end right before "Class", or "Interview 2" might be the same length as "Interview" scheduled right before. Consider whether the inferred end time would cause an overlap — sometimes people are just double-booked and that's fine, but avoid unnecessary conflicts. 

Set the `end_time` field as a CalendarDateTime matching the start's format (same timezone).
