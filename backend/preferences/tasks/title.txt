## TITLE

Rewrite the event title to match the user's established naming conventions.

Look at the reference events from the user's history. They are your primary reference for how this user names things. Consider what patterns you see — do they use brackets for course codes? Abbreviations? A specific casing style? Your title should look like it belongs in the same calendar.

Think about whether the extracted title is a rough version of something the user would write more precisely. "cs 1680 lecture" from a user who writes "[CS1680] Lecture" should match that format.

IMPORTANT: Use the input summary and other events in this batch to understand what each event actually is. A generic "HW7 Due" alongside "ENGN 0520 Lecture" clearly belongs to ENGN 0520 — don't guess a different course from similar historical events. The batch context is the primary signal for identity; the reference events are for formatting style.
