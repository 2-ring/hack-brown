   - Use their bullet point style if applicable
   - Add section headers if they use them
   - Place URLs according to their preference

3. **Color Assignment**:
   - Infer appropriate colorId based on event type and their color mappings
   - Use default color if no specific mapping found

4. **Duration Inference**:

   - Use their default event length as fallback

5. **Location Formatting**:
   - Format virtual meeting locations in their style
