DropCal uses AI to convert unstructured content (text, images, PDFs, audio) into calendar events. We use calendar.events to (1) read existing events to check for scheduling conflicts and learn the user's formatting preferences, and (2) create events only after the user reviews, edits, and explicitly confirms them from a review screen. The read-only scope calendar.events.readonly is not sufficient because our core feature is adding user-approved events to their calendar.
